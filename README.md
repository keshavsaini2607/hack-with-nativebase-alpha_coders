# Hello Viewer 
# First screen consists of code files which can be run on all three platforms i.e android, ios and web
# Deployed web link also there for both screens:

# Same goes for the second build folder it contains code files and deployed web link is right here

Both these screens are entirely made on expo and used all native base components only.
Made responsive using two methods
in first one we have used #useBreakPointValue
and for the second one we have used #useMediaQuery hook.
# These are completely web and mobile responsive
